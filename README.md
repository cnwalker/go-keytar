# go-keytar

Cross-platform system keychain access library for Go.

This package is largely based on the
[node-keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) package

This package is designed to add, get, replace, and delete passwords in the
system's keychain.  On OS X the passwords are managed by the Keychain, on Linux
they are managed by GNOME Keyring, and on Windows they are managed by Credential
Vault.
